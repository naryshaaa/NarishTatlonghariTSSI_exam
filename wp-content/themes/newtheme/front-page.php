				        <p class="card-text"><small>I had an excellent experience using Dominique from Think in Hobart. She alerted me to TAS Property search (especially helpful as I live interstate and don't have local knowledge) and as a result of using that service I uncovered the property I was buying in Launceston was in a medium landslide hazard area. I was able to pull of the contract at no penalty and Dominique was even able to cancel the council certificates at no cost. I will definitely use Dominique again when I find the right investment property to purchase. Really impressed with the professional and thorough service.</small></p>

										Hi Seasalt Peanut butter, <br>
										Thank you for your amazing review of us. All the kind words you have just said are the epitome of our team here at Think; friendliness, willingness and professionalism. These are the traits that we always aim for to deliver a quality service and we are proud to uphold these values as a team. However, we do more than get our clients to settlement. Our services offer more than getting our customers from point A to point B and I’m sure this was reflected during your experience with us. We believe in making connections, in doing more than expected and running the extra mile. But we also believe in working alongside with great people like yourself who take our advice openly and choose to trust in the services we provide. This results in building great relationships and in successful settlements where everyone is happy and satisfied, just the way conveyancing should be. Once again, thank you for your feedback and we wish you all the best.<br>

										<br>Kind regards,<br>

										<br>Think Conveyancing
